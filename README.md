# Datapack-Animate-anything-Serverfriendly
After the pack is activated, you can immediately start animating your structures due to the simple implementation.
Whether you animate your double door so that it disappears into the wall to the left and right, or whether you build your own structures, everything is possible.
All you have to do is put renamed papers into a chest that is linked to the blocks you want to animate, add power to the chest with a repeater and start the animation you set up yourself.
You don't think it's that simple.
Then try it out!
